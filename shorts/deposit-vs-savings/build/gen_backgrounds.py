"""AI scene backgrounds with SDXL + SDXL-Lightning (4 steps), one per scene, cached in ai_bg/.

Runs on CPU in bfloat16 (about 5 minutes and 11 GB RAM per image). Needs torch, diffusers,
transformers, accelerate, peft and access to huggingface.co / *.hf.co. Existing images are
kept, so delete ai_bg/Sxx.png to redraw one scene.
    python gen_backgrounds.py [S05 S12 ...]
Both models are CreativeML Open RAIL++-M (commercial use allowed).
